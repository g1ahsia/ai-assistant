# AI Prompt Improvements for Better Document Query Responses

## Changes Made

### 1. **Increased Semantic Search Threshold (0.10 → 0.30)**
**File**: `chatbotClient.js`, Line 169

**Problem**: The threshold of 0.10 was too low, causing the AI to receive many irrelevant documents, which diluted the quality of responses.

**Solution**: Increased to 0.30 to ensure only reasonably relevant documents are included in the context.

**Impact**: 
- More focused, accurate responses
- Reduced noise from irrelevant documents
- Faster processing due to fewer sources to analyze

---

### 2. **Enhanced System Prompt Structure**
**File**: `chatbotClient.js`, Lines 92-139

**Previous Issues**:
- Too verbose with repetitive examples
- Lacked clear operational guidelines
- Mixed identity info with operational rules

**New Structure**:
```
1. CORE IDENTITY - Who Panlo is and what it does
2. FUNDAMENTAL RULES - 7 key operational principles:
   - Language matching
   - Context awareness
   - Accuracy over speculation
   - Efficient communication
   - Source integrity
   - User experience
   - Error handling
```

**Benefits**:
- Clearer hierarchy of instructions
- Easier for AI to parse and follow
- More comprehensive coverage of edge cases
- Better error handling guidance

---

### 3. **Improved Precise Mode Prompt**
**File**: `chatbotClient.js`, Lines 187-234

**Previous Issues**:
- Overly complex TYPE A/B/C classification system
- Confusing instructions about "meta" vs "direct" content
- Unclear extraction priorities

**New 5-Step Process**:
1. **Understand the Query** - Identify query type and constraints
2. **Analyze All Sources** - Evaluate relevance, quality, contradictions
3. **Extract and Synthesize** - Get relevant info, handle duplicates
4. **Handle Edge Cases** - No results, incomplete info, need clarification
5. **Format Response** - Structure, language, citations

**Key Improvements**:
- Explicit instruction to check ALL sources, not just first matches
- Guidance on handling contradictions between sources
- Clear protocol for incomplete or missing information
- Quality checklist at the end

---

### 4. **Improved General Mode Prompt**
**File**: `chatbotClient.js`, Lines 235-279

**Previous Issues**:
- Too vague and unstructured
- No clear guidance on when to use documents vs. general knowledge
- Unclear handling of follow-up queries

**New 5-Step Process**:
1. **Understand the Request** - Intent, follow-ups, language
2. **Choose Information Sources** - Clear priority order
3. **Formulate Response** - Balance context and knowledge
4. **Handle Special Cases** - Translations, summaries, analysis
5. **Format and Cite** - Language, citations, conversational tone

**Key Improvements**:
- **Clear source priority hierarchy**:
  1. Conversation history (for follow-ups)
  2. Document context (for document questions)
  3. General knowledge (for context/explanations)
- Better guidance on when to cite vs. when not to cite
- Explicit handling of special request types

---

### 5. **Increased Response Token Limit (1024 → 2048)**
**File**: `chatbotClient.js`, Line 309

**Reason**: Complex queries with multiple sources often need more detailed, comprehensive answers.

**Impact**: AI can provide more complete responses without truncation.

## Expected Improvements

### Query Type Coverage

| Query Type | Previous Performance | Expected Improvement |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Simple fact lookup** | Good | Better source selection |
| **Complex multi-source** | Moderate | Much better - systematic analysis |
| **Contradictory info** | Poor | Good - explicit handling |
| **Follow-up questions** | Good | Better - clearer priority system |
| **Translation/Summary** | Moderate | Better - explicit handling |
| **Missing information** | Poor | Good - clear error messaging |
| **Ambiguous queries** | Poor | Better - asks for clarification |

---

## Testing Recommendations

Test these query types to validate improvements:

### 1. **Multi-Source Queries**
```
"What are all the requirements mentioned in my project documents?"
```
Expected: AI reads ALL sources, combines information, cites multiple sources.

### 2. **Contradiction Detection**
```
"What is the deadline for the project?"
```
(When multiple documents have different dates)
Expected: AI mentions the discrepancy and lists all dates with sources.

### 3. **Incomplete Information**
```
"What is the budget breakdown for Q4?"
```
(When only partial info exists)
Expected: AI provides available info and states what's missing.

### 4. **Ambiguous Queries**
```
"Tell me about the report"
```
(When multiple reports exist)
Expected: AI asks which report or lists all options.

### 5. **Follow-up Context**
```
User: "Show me the Q4 budget"
AI: [provides budget]
User: "Translate to Japanese"
```
Expected: AI translates the budget info, not searches for new documents.

### 6. **No Results**
```
"What are the sales figures for 2030?"
```
Expected: Clear message stating no relevant documents found.

### 7. **Duplicate Detection**
```
"What does document X say?"
```
(When multiple similar versions exist)
Expected: AI mentions duplicates and suggests cleanup.

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Fine-Tuning Search Threshold

Current: `0.30`

Adjust based on your needs:
- **0.20-0.25**: More comprehensive but may include some irrelevant results
- **0.30-0.35**: Balanced (recommended)
- **0.35-0.50**: Very precise but may miss some relevant documents
- **0.50+**: Extremely strict, use for exact match scenarios

**Location**: `chatbotClient.js`, Line 169

### Adjusting TopK (Number of Retrieved Documents)

Current: `30`

Adjust based on corpus size:
- **10-20**: Small document collections
- **30-50**: Medium collections (current setting)
- **50-100**: Large collections with many related documents

**Location**: `chatbotClient.js`, Line 169

### Response Token Limits

Current: `2048`

Adjust based on use case:
- **1024-1536**: Quick, concise answers
- **2048**: Comprehensive responses (current setting)
- **3072-4096**: Very detailed analysis (higher cost)

**Location**: `chatbotClient.js`, Line 309

## Monitoring & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **User Satisfaction**
   - Are users getting the information they need?
   - Do they have to rephrase queries?

2. **Citation Accuracy**
   - Are source citations correct?
   - Are all used sources cited?

3. **Response Completeness**
   - Does AI check all relevant sources?
   - Are contradictions detected?

4. **Language Consistency**
   - Does AI always respond in the user's language?

5. **Token Usage**
   - Average tokens per query (should be within budget)
   - Completion token usage (affects cost)

### Quick Fixes for Common Issues

**Issue**: AI still misses relevant documents
- **Solution**: Decrease search threshold (try 0.25)

**Issue**: AI includes too many irrelevant sources
- **Solution**: Increase search threshold (try 0.35-0.40)

**Issue**: Responses are too verbose
- **Solution**: Reduce max_tokens or add "Be concise" to system prompt

**Issue**: AI doesn't detect contradictions
- **Solution**: Add more examples in the prompt of what contradictions look like

**Issue**: Poor multilingual performance
- **Solution**: Add language-specific examples to system prompt

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Consider Using GPT-4 for Complex Queries

Currently using: `gpt-4o-mini`

For queries requiring deeper analysis, consider:
```javascript
model: userQuery.length > 200 ? 'gpt-4' : 'gpt-4o-mini'
```

### 2. Add Query Classification

Before semantic search, classify query intent:
- Factual lookup
- Comparative analysis
- Summarization
- Translation
- File management

This allows mode-specific optimization.

### 3. Implement Response Quality Scoring

After each response, evaluate:
- Citation accuracy (are IDs valid?)
- Language consistency (matches user query?)
- Completeness (did it answer the question?)

### 4. Add Conversation Context Window

Current: Last 5 interactions

Consider expanding for complex multi-turn conversations:
```javascript
maxHistoryLength: 10  // for better context retention
```

**Location**: `chatbotMemory.js`, Line 4

### 5. Enhance Metadata Usage

Current sources include: filename, fileType, folderName, score

Consider also showing:
- Creation date
- Last modified date
- File size
- Author (if available)

This helps users identify the most relevant/recent sources.

## Summary

These improvements provide:
✅ More accurate source selection (threshold increase)
✅ Better structured decision-making (step-by-step prompts)
✅ Explicit handling of edge cases (contradictions, missing info)
✅ Clearer operational guidelines (system prompt restructure)
✅ More comprehensive responses (increased token limit)

**Result**: The AI should now handle a much wider variety of queries more accurately and reliably.
